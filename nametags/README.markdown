These are some simple name tags.
================================

First in Inkscape write your text. I am using the Willy Wonker one here.

Then select it all, and covert object to a path.
Then select all the paths and  then make segments into lines.
You may want to up the number of nodes first.

Then save as the Destop Cutting Plotter format in version dxf and then you can
load it in the files
