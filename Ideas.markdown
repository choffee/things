Some crazy ideas of things that I might make any suggestions welcome
====================================================================

As I think of things that I might like to make I may note them here. One day I may even make them.

Phone stand
-----------
  Android sitting down and just resting on legs
  Android with phone in backpack
  Two arms that hold it a bit like a bair of scissors

Headphone stand for Sennheisers
-------------------------------
  Should be easy to drop headphones on.
  Could have a small head with a funky haircut to rest it on.
  Perhpas a person holding their hands out.
  A large ear.

Prusa shoes
-----------
  No real purpose just shoes that would fit over the feet on my Prusa so they don't get cold.

RAMPS factory topper
--------------------

Nice to have a top that fits over the RAMPS electronics and has a small industiral landscape over the top.
Allowing the warm air to escape up the chimnys and maybe the wires come in on some train tracks.

Park Bench ends for coffee stirers
----------------------------------

When you get a coffee or tea on the train they give you a little wooden stick to stir it with. I think it would be cool to make a small park bench from them by printing a couple of ends.

Interlocking mugs
-----------------

Mugs that latch together so that you can carry more than one back to the office at a time using a single handle.

Cablecar
--------

I have always coverted a toy cable car. Would be nice to print one.

Terminator USB drive
--------------------

A model of the chip from the terminator that can take a USB drive.
