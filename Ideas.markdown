Some crazy ideas of things that I might make any suggestions welcome
====================================================================

As I think of things that I might like to make I may note them here. One day I may even make them.

Phone stand
-----------
  Android sitting down and just resting on legs
  Android with phone in backpack
  Two arms that hold it a bit like a bair of scissors

Headphone stand for Sennheisers
-------------------------------
  Should be easy to drop headphones on.
  Could have a small head with a funky haircut to rest it on.
  Perhpas a person holding their hands out.
  A large ear.

Prusa shoes
-----------
  No real purpose just shoes that would fit over the feet on my Prusa so they don't get cold.
